# Dynamic Web Page Project

This project requires you to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Dynamic Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For more detailed requirements, see the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
